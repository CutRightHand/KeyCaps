# KeyCaps
High quality STEP and STL keycap models

Please visit the releases page to get an archive with the current version of
the prepared resources. 

The directories inside the archive represent the keycap profile in question, while the file names have the following structure:

xRyyyUm.(stl|stp)

x = Row indicator, starting from the row farthest away from the user of the
keyboard. This row numbering is the natural row numbering for SA keycaps, but
might be inverted for some other profiles.

yyy = width of the keycap model, expressed as hundredths of keycap unit size
(19.05mm). Eg 625 is a 6.25u keycap model commonly used for space bars.

m = modifier, as follows
    * HD - homing dish
    * HB - homing bump
    * HL - homing line
    * C - convex (typically for space bars)
